# Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are considered by many to be the most powerful 'black box' learning algorithm, and by posing a cleverly-chosen optimization objective, one of the most widely used learning algorithms today.

With supervised learning, the performance of many supervised learning algorithms will be pretty similar, and what matters less often will be whether you use learning algorithm a or learning algorithm b, but what matters more will often be things like the amount of data you create these algorithms on, as well as your skill in applying these algorithms. Things like your choice of the features you design to give to the learning algorithms, and how you choose the colorization parameter, and things like that. 

But, there's one more algorithm that is very powerful and is very widely used both within industry and academia, and that's called the support vector machine. And compared to both logistic regression and neural networks, the Support Vector Machine, or SVM sometimes gives a cleaner, and sometimes more powerful way of learning complex non-linear functions.
