# Further Reading

## Informative Web Sites

* [A Brief Introduction to Machine Learning by Gunnar Ratsch](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/files/105-machine-learning-paper.pdf)

* [CS229 Machine Learning - Stanford ](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) - This is the Stanford CS course on Machine Learning that Prof Ng has taught for a number of years. The material parallels the Coursera course, but covers some additional topics and goes into much more depth on the mathematics.

* [Dive into Machine Learning](http://hangtwenty.github.io/dive-into-machine-learning/) - Compiles a variety of resources, taking a hack-first approach so you can get "hooked." Prof. Ng's course is the centerpiece.
