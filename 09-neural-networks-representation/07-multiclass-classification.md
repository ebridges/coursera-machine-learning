## Multiclass Classification

To classify data into multiple classes, we let our hypothesis function return a vector of values. This is similar to the “one vs. all” method that was discussed as part of logistic regression, and the result are a vector of logistic regression classifiers each of which is trying to recognize one of the different classes we want to distinguish between.
