## Motivations: Neurons & the Brain

NN are an old algorithm that was originally motivated by having machines that can mimic the brain.  They were very widely used in the 80s and early 90s, but their popularity diminished in the late 90s. However they work really well for modern-day machine learning problems and have recently experienced a resurgence for that purpose.

One may imagine that the brain operates with many different programs â€” one to learn calculus, one to remember your birthday, another to recognize a tree, etc. etc.. However a recent hypothesis emerged that instead that the way the brain does it is to use a single learning algorithm. One experiment that was done on an animal was to reroute visual signals to the auditory area of the brain, and then that area of the brain learned the ability to see.  These neural rewiring experiments demonstrate that if the same area of brain tissue can learn a variety of different skills, maybe there is a single learning algorithm that the brain uses to learn. It's pretty amazing how one can plug any sense data into the brain and the brain's learning algorithm will learn how to deal with it.
